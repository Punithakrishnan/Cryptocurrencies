# Cryptocurrencies

### Overview

---

We have used unsupervised learning to analyze cryptocurrency market data. Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, has an interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. Theyâ€™ve asked us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped together to create a classification system for a new investment. The data were preprocessed processed to fit the machine learning models. To group the cryptocurrencies, a clustering algorithms was used that included an initial Principal Component Analysis (PCA) before K-Means Clustering was used for clustering.

#### Tools Used:

Python, Pandas
Scikit Learn
Preprocessing
PCA
K-Means Clustering
Imbalanced-learn
Git

### Method

Imported to Pandas data frames (from csv files) and created crypto_df
Kept all the cryptocurrencies that are being traded
Dropped the IsTrading column
Removed rows that have at least one null value
Filtered the crypto_df DataFrame so it only has rows where coins have been mined
Created a new DataFrame that holds only the cryptocurrency names, and used the crypto_df DataFrame index as the index for this new DataFrame
Removed the CoinName column from the crypto_df DataFrame
For Algorithm and Proof columns, dummy variables were created, and a new data frame X was created
Data were standardized
PCA was performed and a new data frame was created with the first 3 principal components
The best k value for K-Means clustering was determined by using Elbow curve
K-Means clustering model was created using k = 4 and PCA components
A data table was created with tradable Cryptocurrencies
